# Beetz Store üêù ‚Äî Minimal E-commerce App (Flutter)

"Beetz" is a fictional brand that I created during highschool with my bestfriend, and recently I've decided to incorporate our idea into a minimalist E-commerce app fully developed in Flutter!
This app is still on development, and I plan on adding a lot more functionalities to it, as well as a version with an integrated API.

## Deploy

Web deploy: https://gustevito.github.io/flutter_ecommerce_app/app/

## Clone repository
```
git clone https://github.com/gustevito/flutter_ecommerce_app
```

## Set-up Flutter

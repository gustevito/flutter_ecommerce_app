# Beetz Store üêù / Minimal E-commerce App (Flutter)

"Beetz" is a fictional brand that I've created during highschool with my bestfriend, and recently I've decided to incorporate our idea into a minimalist E-commerce app fully developed in Flutter!

This app is still on development, and I plan on adding a lot more functionalities to it, as well as a version with an integrated API.

# Beetz Store üêù

"Beetz" is a fictional brand that I've created during highschool with my bestfriend, and recently I've decided to incorporate our idea into an E-commerce app!

This app is still on development, and I plan on adding a lot more functionalities to it, as well as a version with an integrated API.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
